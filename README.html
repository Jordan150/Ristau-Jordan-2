This is a website for a fake pokemon game that was designed by Ron Sroor A.k.a Truegreen7.

Page 1 is the home page with a small amount of info about the games, the new game mechanic, and other things.

Page 2 is the Pok√©dex which lists several of Ron's own original Pokemon that he made for the fictional region. I made several sections with a few examples of common categories of pokemon found in most games.

Page 3 is all about the Characters that Ron made for the region and the actual Lore of the game and region itself.
