            <h2>Asones Creator</h2>
            <p>Asone and all of its pokemon, characters, and lore all were created by Ron Sroor. All artwork shown here was originally made by him. You can find more information about him and the games on his Youtube channel called Truegreen7. While the Asone region is just a concept he created he went in depth detailing how the games would be and has created many more pokemon than shown here. </p>
